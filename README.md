## Hi there, I am Mikkel Garcia (pronounced Michael) ðŸ‘‹ 

Professionally I have helped create many startups as part of small engineering teams.
As a startup cofounder I have deployed apps to multiple marketplaces, supported hundreds of saas customers and tens of thousands of daily active users.

I'm interested in helping startups or small teams develop cool things. If this is something you are looking for, please feel free to email - mikkel AT 255bits DOT com.

### ðŸŒ± Technologies I've used professionally to build things or help startups:

- **Python** - Used in web development, ml work, and many small scripts.
- **JavaScript/nodejs/coffeescript** - Released multiple production nodejs apps.
- **AI Inference (Stable Diffusion / LLMS such as ChatGPT)** - I am an independent AI researcher and am continously amazed.
- **AI Training with PyTorch/tensorflow** - See my trained stable diffusion loras at https://sliders.ntcai.xyz
- **Grafana/Prometheus** - Financial reports that run every 5 minutes, product health reports among others.
- **Ruby/rails** - Attended the first railsconf, long time builder/consultant across many startups.
- **Docker/docker swarm** - Custom deployment for my apps that serve thousands of users daily.
- **HTMX** - Used on nftcardx.com among other projects.
- **Postgres/MariaDB** - Several projects deployed using SQL.
- **React** - Used in multiple live applications. Can lead to leaky abstractions and hard to debug issues but it also can be very readable and well abstracted.
- **PHP/jQuery** - Maintained application for several years and have developed a wordpress plugin.
- **CouchDB** - Live for several years, this nosql database is powerful.
