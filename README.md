## Hi there, I am Mikkel Garcia (pronounced Michael) ðŸ‘‹ 

I have been a developer for years. Most of my recent development has happened on Bitbucket so don't let my GitHub activity log mislead you. See 2017 for an activity chart where I primarily used github.

Professionally I have helped create many startups as part of small engineering teams.

### ðŸ”­ Technologies I use every day:

- Python - It's so good at _everything_
- AI Inference (Stable Diffusion / LLMS such as ChatGPT) - I have been a long time AI independent researcher and I am continously amazed.
- JavaScript - I have a history with coffeescript and node as well. Javascript is everywhere.
- AI Training with PyTorch - See my trained stable diffusion loras at https://ntcai.xyz
- Grafana - financial reports that run every 5 minutes, product health reports among others.

### ðŸŒ± I've professionally used the following technologies to help startups:

- Ruby/rails - went to the first railsconf, long time builder/consultant across many startups.
- Docker - custom deployment for my apps that serve thousands of users daily.
- HTMX - used on nftcardx.com (web3 card listing site) 
- Postgres/MariaDB - served millions of records and created domain object models

### Technologies I use to maintain existing projects:

- PHP - no comment ðŸ˜‰
- React - Good but I prefer simpler in practice
- CouchDB - a lesser known but very cool datastore using javascript and json

I am an AI-first developer and have co-founded [255 Labs](https://255labs.xyz). I am pro-cryptocurrency as a technology. It's currently hard to separate the financial parts of cryptocurrency from actual benefits but it is that way with all new technology before they are refined.
