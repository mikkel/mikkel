## Hi there, I am Mikkel Garcia (pronounced Michael) ðŸ‘‹ 

Professionally I have helped create many startups as part of small engineering teams.
As a startup cofounder I have deployed apps to multiple marketplaces, supported hundreds of saas customers and tens of thousands of daily active users.

I'm interested in helping startups or small teams develop cool things. If this is something you are looking for, please feel free to email - mikkel AT 255bits DOT com.

### ðŸŒ± Technologies I've used professionally to build things or help startups:

- Python - I used to reach for Ruby for small scripts, but now I reach for Python.
- AI Inference (Stable Diffusion / LLMS such as ChatGPT) - I have been a long time AI independent researcher and I am continously amazed.
- JavaScript - I have a history with coffeescript and node as well. Javascript is everywhere.
- AI Training with PyTorch - See my trained stable diffusion loras at https://ntcai.xyz
- Grafana - financial reports that run every 5 minutes, product health reports among others.
- Ruby/rails - went to the first railsconf, long time builder/consultant across many startups.
- Docker - custom deployment for my apps that serve thousands of users daily.
- HTMX - used on nftcardx.com (web3 card listing site) 
- Postgres/MariaDB - SQL is everywhere.
- React - React can be powerful but it also can lead to leaky abstractions. I generally prefer simpler frameworks but there is no denying the success.
- PHP/jQuery - no comment ðŸ˜‰
- CouchDB - a lesser known but very cool datastore using javascript and json

### Vision & Future Outlook

* Picking up AI has never been more important. The trend has been clear for years.
* I am pro-cryptocurrency as a technology and social movement. Proof of work needs to be refactored and crypto should embrace technological advances.
* The future is individualized, generated and amazing.
